# Cryptography-Encryption-Algorithms
There are various cryptography algorithms present. Here are some of the well known cryptography algorithms.

# 1. Affine Cipher
The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.

# 2. Ceaser Cipher
The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet.

# 3. Hill Cipher
The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher built on concepts from Linear Algebra. The Hill cipher makes use of modulo arithmetic, matrix multiplication, and matrix inverses.

# 4. Playfair Cipher
The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. It is the same as a traditional cipher. The only difference is that it encrypts a digraph (a pair of two letters) instead of a single letter.

# 5. Rail Fence Cipher
The rail fence cipher (also called a zigzag cipher) is a form of classical transposition cipher. It derives its name from the manner in which encryption is performed.

# 6. Row Transposition Cipher
A transposition cipher is one which rearranges the order of the letters in the ciphertext (encoded text), according to some predetermined method, without making any substitutions.

# 7. Vigenere Cipher
Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table.
